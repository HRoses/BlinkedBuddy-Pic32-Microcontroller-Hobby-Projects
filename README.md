# Hobby Project - Pic32 Microcontroller
# Button Controlled Blinking Led

This is a hobby project of mine, built on a breadboard with Pic32 Microcontroller using MPLAB SNAP Programmer/Debugger. 

This current project will blink Led lights (Green and Blue) using the 3 buttons I have installed on the breadboard. 

### My Goal is to make a youtube series out of these mini projects that I will do and learn about.
